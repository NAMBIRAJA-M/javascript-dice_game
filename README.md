Once you have the game open in your browser, you can start playing by following these steps:

Click "Roll Dice" to roll the dice.
The result of the dice roll will be displayed, and the current score for the active player will be updated.
Click "Hold" to save the current score to the player's total score.
The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

* Game Rules
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their TOTAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points on TOTAL score wins the game.
